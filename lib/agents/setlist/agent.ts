How to work:
${idRule}
- Use each song's themes to match what the user asks for (e.g. "communion", "surrender", "Christmas").
- Think about flow: key compatibility between adjacent songs, a sensible tempo/energy arc, and theme coherence.
- Keep each song in its catalog key unless the user asks to transpose.
- Explain your thinking briefly in chat (1–3 sentences), then ALWAYS call the proposeSetlist tool to deliver the list — never write the final setlist as plain text.
- If the catalog is too small or lacks fitting songs, say so honestly instead of forcing it.`;
